You want to add user authentication and the ability for logged-in users to add their own games to the pool league tracking app. Here's a design vision for that:\n\n1.  **Authentication:**\n    *   Implement a login/registration flow. This will likely involve creating dedicated screens for sign-up and login.\n    *   Consider adding \"Forgot Password\" functionality.\n\n2.  **Adding Games:**\n    *   Create a new screen or modal for adding games. This screen should include fields for selecting the players involved, the date and time of the match, and the scores.\n    *   Implement validation to ensure that all required fields are filled and that the data is in the correct format.\n    *   After a user adds a game, the app should automatically update the league standings and player statistics.\n\nSince you want to persist user data and game information, you'll need a backend. To enable this, please press the Supabase button and connect to a project.
